# Assignment 3 – Functions & Modules in Python

This assignment focuses on using functions and built-in Python modules to perform mathematical calculations.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
- Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument
- Calculates the factorial of the number using a loop or recursion
- Returns the calculated factorial
- Calls the function with a sample value and displays the output

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
- Takes a number as input from the user
- Uses Python's built-in `math` module to calculate:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays the calculated results

## How to Run
Run the programs using Python:

```bash
python "Task 1.py"
python "Task 2.py"
