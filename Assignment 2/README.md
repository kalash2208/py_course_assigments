# Assignment 2 – Control Structures in Python

This assignment demonstrates the use of control structures in Python, including conditional statements and loops.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Uses an if-else statement to check whether the number is even or odd
- Displays the result accordingly

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50
- Calculates the sum of all integers in this range
- Displays the final sum

## How to Run
Run the programs using Python:

```bash
python "Task 1.py"
python "Task 2.py"
